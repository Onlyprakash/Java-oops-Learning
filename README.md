# üìò PROJECT OVERVIEW :-
Welcome to this focused repository dedicated to mastering the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. This project moves beyond theory by providing four clean, separate, and runnable examples. Each file is a practical demonstration of a single core concept, making it an excellent resource for learning and revision.

# ‚ú® The four pillars covered are:

* Encapsulation

* Inheritance

* Abstraction

* Polymorphism

# üîç Deeper Dive into Each Pillar
Below is a detailed look at each principle, complete with a code snapshot from the relevant file.

1. Encapsulation

Concept: Think of it like a protective capsule. Encapsulation bundles the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data together, hiding the data from outside interference.

File: Encapsulation.java
