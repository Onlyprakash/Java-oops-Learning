# üìò PROJECT OVERVIEW :-
Welcome to this focused repository dedicated to mastering the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. This project moves beyond theory by providing four clean, separate, and runnable examples. Each file is a practical demonstration of a single core concept, making it an excellent resource for learning and revision.

# ‚ú® The four pillars covered are:

* Encapsulation

* Inheritance

* Abstraction

* Polymorphism

# üîç Deeper Dive into Each Pillar :-
Below is a detailed look at each principle, complete with a code snapshot from the relevant file.

# 1. Encapsulation

Concept: Think of it like a protective capsule. Encapsulation bundles the data (attributes) and the methods that operate on that data together, hiding the data from outside interference.

‚û§ File: Encapsulation.java  

# 2. Inheritance

Concept: This is the "is-a" relationship, like passing down family traits. A new class (child/subclass) can inherit fields and methods from an existing class (parent/superclass), which promotes code reuse.

‚û§ File: Inheritance.java

# 3. Abstraction

Concept: This is about hiding complexity. Think of a TV remote: you know the "power" button turns it on, but you don't need to know how it works internally. Abstraction defines a contract that other classes must follow.

‚û§ File: Abstraction.java

# 4. Polymorphism

Concept: Meaning "many forms," this principle allows a single action to be performed in different ways. In Java, this is seen in Method Overriding (run-time) and Method Overloading (compile-time).

‚û§ File: Polymorphism.java

# üõ†Ô∏è TECHNOLOGIES USED :-

‚û§ Programming Language: Java

‚û§ IDE Support: IntelliJ IDEA

‚û§ Java Version: JDK 8 or above
