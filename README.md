# ðŸ“˜ PROJECT OVERVIEW :-
Welcome to this focused repository dedicated to mastering the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. This project moves beyond theory by providing four clean, separate, and runnable examples. Each file is a practical demonstration of a single core concept, making it an excellent resource for learning and revision.

# âœ¨ The four pillars covered are:

* Encapsulation

* Inheritance

* Abstraction

* Polymorphism
